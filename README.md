# paintAppC#

A paint-like C# program where we can draw geometric shapes. 
When shapes are selected, other functions work except highlighting the shape and related buttons. As such, I believe the program reflects concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction well.
I will also try to fix the transparency and smooth appearance of the background of the drawn shapes and the highlighting of the buttons and shapes.
